## Description 

 This is a portfolio website I created using React, showcasing my projects and skills as a web developer. It includes a collection of my completed projects, demonstrating my proficiency in various web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is presented with a link to the live deployment and the corresponding GitHub repository. 

 I'd like to mention here that I used the name "PortfolioContainer" instead of "Project" for one of my components, and I used the name "NavTabs" instead of "Navigation" for another component.  

## Usage

- If you would like to view a short description about me, you can visit the 'About Me' page.
- To view a collection of my projects, you can navigate to the 'Portfolio' page.
- If you wish to view or download my resume, you can visit the 'Resume' page and scroll to the bottom. There you will find a button that will direct you to my resume, and there will be an option to download it if you would like. 

## Credits

- My instructor, Diego, helped me with the blur functions that notify the user when they leave the email input field without entering a valid email address, and the message input field without leaving a message. 
- My tutor, Alex Gonzalez, introduced me to Framer Motion. He also helped me create the link for my resume. 
- If I referenced an activity for a certain file, I included a comment that indicates which activity I referenced for each file at the top of that file.
