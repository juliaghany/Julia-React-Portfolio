                Hello, I'm Julia Hany, an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for creating engaging and dynamic online experiences. 
                I have nearly completed a comprehensive web development course through Columbia Engineering Boot Camp where I've gained a solid 
                foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. Prior to that, I gained experience as a waitress, honing my communication
                and time management skills in a fast-paced environment. Working closely with diverse guests, I developed exceptional interpersonal 
                skills, effectively listening to their needs and providing top-notch service. This experience taught me the importance of clear and 
                concise communication, adaptability, and working collaboratively as part of a team.

                I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I have worked with popular frameworks such as React and Node.js.
                I'm also skilled in version control using Git and have a basic understanding of databases and SQL.

                During the web development course, I completed several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.
                One of my notable projects was building a dynamic website that enables users to search for movies, discover recommended films, 
                and create personalized movie lists.

                Outside of coding, you can find me exploring nature on hiking trails, expressing my creativity through various forms of art, 
                or playing my favorite instruments. I believe these interests contribute to my ability to think outside the box and apporach
                coding challenges with a fresh perspective.
                
                Looking ahead, my goal is to build impactful web applications that enhance user experiences and contribute to the ever-evolving 
                digital world. I'm eager to expand my knowledge, learn new technologies, and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the industry.
